\begin{abstract}
Android testing still has many areas to cover in order to make automated testing of Android applications as thorough as possible.  One area of research that has yet to be investigated is automating testing of Android applications against changing device states.  Device states can and do change during the usage of applications and do impact the usability of an app.

This paper creates a way to easily test multiple device states against an existing Android application's test suites.  We built a tool that we called TADS (Test application to device state) that enables a developer to very easily run their Espresso test suites against multiple state changes in the device.
